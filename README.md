## How to use LootGoblin / Functions  
This app can automatically locate your opened Treasure / Resource Maps and can read from your Mastery and Aspect Tomes.  
  
Open the Tome or Treasure Map you want to read.  
Make sure that they are completly visible. However, they don't have to be in the black area of the client.

Now you can press "Scan" and the app will automatically locate the map (if you have one open) and will tell you the best Rune for all 4 different major Rune Systems!

After adjusting the price and (de)activating some items you might want to keep for yourself, you can press "Sell" to create the pastable string direclty to your clipboard.

## Treasure Maps / Resource Maps / Fishing Maps
After the succesful import of any Map, the location of the Map will be shown on the button (e.g. 1087, 2648).
By pressing the button, [ExploreOutlands.com](http://www.exploreoutlands.com) will be opened with the exact coordinates of the location.

It will also directly show you which Rune Tome and which Recall Rune you should use for this specific location.
Currently are four different number systems supported:

  1. General Map System ([More info](https://forums.uooutlands.com/index.php?threads/outlands-treasure-map.3051/#lg=attachment4455&slide=0))
  2. Witchers Map System ([More info](https://forums.uooutlands.com/index.php?threads/witchers-guide-to-tmaps-how-you-can-and-why-you-should-be-running-your-own-tmaps.3439/))
  3. BlackDragons Map System ([More info](https://forums.uooutlands.com/index.php?threads/blackdragons-advanced-tmapping-guide-auto-tmap-helpers.3654/))
  4. Points of Interest ([More info](https://uooutlands.com/wiki/Points_of_Interest))

The colored square, next to the Rune Tome, is indicating the Rune Tome color. The number or name, next to the Rune, tells you which rune to recall to.
The number behind the footsteps is the approximately distance from the marked rune to the Treasure Map location in a straight line.

## LootGoblin Light   
When you setting up a massive Resource or Treasure Map run, the big UI of LootGoblin might be not handy for you. The new UI of LootGoblin Light can simply be activated by the middle button in the upper righthand corner of the LootGoblin window:   
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52481026/140176919-2b2e5cf9-11f1-40dc-b81f-dc133d54bf97.png)  
The very small UI of LootGoblin Light has the same functionality as the regular one, but its UI seamlessly fits into your client and will stay always on top if you active the option.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52481026/140177124-ccc48b2b-89e6-4100-adeb-7018607bd1e5.png)   
   
   
## MapGoblin
The Minimap you see in the picture above is the new MapGoblin Minimap and can either started manually through the MapGoblin.exe or by pressing the MapGoblin (Both files have to be in the same directory...):  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52481026/140177740-64368615-9e4c-4a37-b8bf-7a32754f91cb.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52481026/140177772-8d454df7-aed1-4a62-b2a6-6eed0ccebdde.png)  
  
  The Next version of MapGoblin will come with full network support. Similar to ExploreOutlands.com you will be able to track all currently logged in guildmates or friends. However they will have to actively log into the server and enter your guilds password.  
   
   
   
## New in version v2.1  
### Added Auto-Scan, PvP-Help-Call feature and a completely new algorithm to locate maps!  
The new version 2.1 features an Auto-Scan, as well as a PvP-Help-Call feature.  
If you active the Auto-Scan, the app will constantly search for new maps and opened tome gumps.  
The PvP-Help-Call feature is only working correctly if you have found a treasure map.  
By pressing one of the buttons below, a string will be created in your clipboard which you can paste directly into your guildchat!
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52481026/148083356-4aca3a92-4d40-4a44-a975-84df99eb2213.png)

The resulting string looks like this:
` Need PvP help | Regular: Zone 50 | Witcher: Rune 10 | BlackDragon: Rune 52 | POI: Western Ruins `  

You can also deactivate rune systems that you are not using with those options:
